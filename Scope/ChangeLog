    - wxWidgets 2.8.10 Library (www.wxWidgets.org) 

  What's New in Rel. 1.5.3
  --------------------------
  
  - fixed bug:  recorded samples' value was not correctly formatted: now, the recorded value
                is the raw value read from the ADC.

  What's New in Rel. 1.5.2
  --------------------------
  
  - fixed bug:  the software stalled when using a DT5751 (and may all the ##51 family) in DES mode 
  - fixed bug:  unsupported board's channels were disabled as GUI controls but not in the 
                underlying channel mask.

  What's New in Rel. 1.5.1
  --------------------------
  
  - fixed bug:  the vertical scale resolution for 51 series was not properly setted
  - fixed bug:  the sample to bit convertion failed above certain signal level due to16 bit variable overflow.
  - fixed bug:  removed wait for exit of working thread (compiling with g++ with optimization for speed 
			    enabled, the test variable m_thrad_exited was removed and always return false, causing an infinite loop,
				furthermore the wait loop was not necessary)
   -fixed bug:	when running on Linux the settings and image files are now correctly fetched from
				the /etc/CAENScope folder.
